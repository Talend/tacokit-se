= Connectors SE Docker

This module prepares a maven repository to be embed in a Docker image.
The `Dockerfile` is ready to run/build to do that but the
docker image creation is not part of the build until it is possible to build an image
without having to rely on a local docker installation and require some version.

The docker build is executed on the CI, see `Jenkinsfile`.
